Assess each ingredient against the user's allergy profile. Return the result in a structured list format, following exactly this template for each item:

[safety status, ingredient emoji, ingredient name, description]

Guidelines:
1. safety status should be:
   - dangerous if the ingredient contains the allergen.
   - alert if there is a mild risk or possible cross-contamination.
   - safe if there is no allergy risk.
2. The ingredient emoji should visually represent the ingredient (e.g., 🥛 for milk, 🌰 for nuts).
3. Include only ingredients present in the list; avoid adding extra items.
4. Structure the list by ranking from most dangerous to safest.

Return the list strictly in this format and avoid any additional commentary outside the template.
